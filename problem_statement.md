# Personal Expense Tracker

## Course-End Project Problem Statement
### Course-End Project: **Personal Expense Tracker**

**Problem statement:**

In today’s fast-paced world, individuals need to track and manage their expenses effectively. Your task is to build a personal expense tracker that allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them, and track spending against a monthly budget. The tracker should also be able to save and load expenses from a file for future reference.

**Objectives:**

1. Design and implement a personal expense tracker that enables users to manage their expenses
2. Allow users to categorize expenses and set monthly budgets
3. Implement file-handling functionality to save and load expense data
4. Create an interactive, menu-driven interface for ease of use

**Steps to perform:**

1. Add an expense:
* Create a function to prompt the user for expense details. Ensure you ask for:
	* The date of the expense in the format YYYY-MM-DD
	* The category of the expense, such as Food or Travel
	* The amount spent
	* A brief description of the expense
* Store the expense in a list as a dictionary, where each dictionary includes the date, category, amount, and description as key-value pairs
	* Example: {'date': '2024-09-18', 'category': 'Food', 'amount': 15.50, 'description': 'Lunch with friends'}

2. View expenses:
* Write a function to retrieve and display all stored expenses
	* Ensure the function loops through the list of expenses and displays the date, category, amount, and description for each entry
* Validate the data before displaying it
	* If any required details (date, category, amount, or description) are missing, skip the entry or notify the user that it’s incomplete

3. Set and track the budget:
* Create a function that allows the user to input a monthly budget. Prompt the user to:
	* Enter the total amount they want to budget for the month
* Create another function that calculates the total expenses recorded so far
	* Compare the total with the user’s monthly budget
	* If the total expenses exceed the budget, display a warning (Example: You have exceeded your budget!)
	* If the expenses are within the budget, display the remaining balance (Example: You have 150 left for the month)

4. Save and load expenses:
* Implement a function to save all expenses to a CSV file, with each row containing the date, category, amount, and description of each expense
* Create another function to load expenses from the CSV file. When the program starts, it should:
	* Read the saved data from the file
	* Load it back into the list of expenses so the user can see their previous expenses and continue from where they left off

5. Create an interactive menu:
* Build a function to display a menu with the following options:
	* Add expense
	* View expenses
	* Track budget
	* Save expenses
	* Exit
* Allow the user to enter a number to choose an option
* Implement the following conditions:
	* If the user selects option 1, call the function to add an expense
	* If the user selects option 2, call the function to view expenses
	* If the user selects option 3, call the function to track the budget
	* If the user selects option 4, call the function to save expenses to the file
	* If the user selects option 5, save the expenses and exit the program
